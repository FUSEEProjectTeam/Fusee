        <member name="T:JSIL.Meta.JSReplacement">
            <summary>
            Specifies that references to this identifier should be replaced with a specified javascript expression when translating code to JavaScript.
            To refer to a parameter within the replacement expression, prefix the parameter name with a dollar sign - the this-reference becomes $this, for example.
            To insert a dollar sign into the replacement expression, write '$$'.
            When replacing a constructor, '$this' can be used to refer to the this-reference if the constructor is being called in-place on a struct instance.

        <member name="T:JSIL.Meta.JSChangeName">

        <member name="T:JSIL.Meta.JSChangeToStaticMethod">
            <summary>

        <member name="T:JSIL.Meta.JSRuntimeDispatch">
            <summary>
            Specifies that, if overloaded, the correct overload of this method to invoke should be decided at runtime instead of compile time.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="T:JSIL.Meta.JSExternal">
            <summary>
            Specifies that this member or type is implemented externally and should not be generated when translating code to JavaScript
             (but does not prevent use of the member/type like <see cref="T:JSIL.Meta.JSIgnore"/> does.)
            Note that while external methods will generate a clear warning at runtime if used without being defined, the same is not true
             for fields or classes - fields will simply be undefined, and classes may produce a JavaScript TypeError or ReferenceError.
            The behavior of external properties depends on where you apply the attribute: Marking the property itself as external means
             that the property definition will be omitted and the getter and setter will not be translated.
            Marking a property's getter or setter as external behaves the same as marking a method as external - the property definition
             will still be translated, so once the externals are implemented the property will work as expected.

        <member name="T:JSIL.Meta.JSExtraStaticConstructor">
            <summary>
            Specifies that this method should be renamed to .cctor2 so that it runs as a second static constructor for the containing
             type in JS. If the method is part of a proxy, it will run as the second static constructor for the proxied type(s).

            If applied to a field, specifies that you wish for JSIL to treat the specified field as if it is immutable.
            Struct copies will not be generated for the annotated field or any of its members.

            <summary>
            Tells the static analyzer that this class represents an array enumerator, and provides the names of the array,

            Tells the static analyzer that the enumerator returned by this method represents an underlying array
             of elements stored in class pointed to by the method's this-reference.
            This enables the static analyzer to entirely remove the call to this method and replace it with
             direct access to the array.
