This Folder is empty by design. Its only purpose is to enable Visual Studio to show the
"Scripts" folder below the .csproj contents.
The Scripts shown in Visual Studio's Solution Explorer below Natives are directly
listed in the respective .csproj file. Script files listed here are located
under [FUSEE root]\ext\JSIL\FrameworkScripts. 
To edit the list of scripts a Web project depends upon, directly edit the .cspoj file!
