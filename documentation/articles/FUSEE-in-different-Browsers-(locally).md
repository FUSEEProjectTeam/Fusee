In general it is recommended to copy the files generated by FUSEE Web builds to a web server. You can easily install a local web server. However, sometimes you might want to view FUSEE Web contents by opening the generated HTML page inside a browser. This might be a problem:

For security reasons, most web browsers will not allow you to view the scene directly from the disk where you saved it by simply double-clicking on the HTML file. Opening the HTML file from a web server will work, though. To open the scene locally with different browsers, try the following:

# Chrome
Chrome use the `--allow-file-access-from-files` command line parameter. On windows you can easily attach this as a start-up parameter on your chrome shortcut.

# Firefox 
you need to go to about:config (just type it in the address bar and hit enter), filter for “origin” and change the “security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy” to false.
